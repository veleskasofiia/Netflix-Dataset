# SQL Project Netflix 

This dataset, officially released by Netflix, comprises a comprehensive collection of all TV shows and movies accessible to subscribers on the Netflix streaming platform throughout the year 2023. By analyzing this dataset, users can uncover patterns in content distribution, popularity, viewer preferences, and more, contributing to a deeper understanding of the streaming landscape. The purpose of this analysis is to practice my SQL skills. You can find the more information of my analysis on my website https://veleskasofiia.wordpress.com/.
